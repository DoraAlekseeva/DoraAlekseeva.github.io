    <p><big><big>To be honest, I had and still have a lot of hobbies, so it is difficult to talk about each in detail (somewhere it can be boring, somewhere it can take a lot of time, and somewhere I don't remember much myself).</big></big></p>

    <big><big>Previously, my parents tried to find a business "to my liking" for me almost everywhere. For several years I have been engaged in ballroom dancing, athletics, swimming, gardening, photography, chess and much more.
        <p>But due to exams in high school, I had to stop it and start studying with tutors. It was a very difficult and hard time for me, because sometimes I didn't even have time for sleep and for minimal walks (I really tried to prepare well for the exams as I could).</p>
    <p>Now, after entering the university, I began to actively get involved in photography, the development of my social networks, and I plan to try myself at new equally interesting hobbies, such as: clay modeling, modern dances, a florist course and others.</p>
