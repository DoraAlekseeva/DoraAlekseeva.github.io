    <p><big><big>I decided to devote this site to myself and some facts about me (as you already understood), but I decided to complicate my task a little and do it in English,because I want and have to practice my language (you will understand why, after reading my site).</big></big></p>

        <big><big>*I don't want to talk all about myself on one page, so you can follow the links and read about my hobbies and interests.</big></big>
<big><big>But as it is, I would like to tell you a little about what is happening now in my life.:)</big></big>
<big><big>I recently finished 11th grade and entered TSPU. Now I spend my time studying, taking photos and my social networks, but of course I would like to find some new hobby.</big></big>
