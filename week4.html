    <p><big><big>I think that all people once (at least) dreamed of something, set goals for themselves and tried to achieve them with all their might. So I am the same person (like everyone else): I dream a lot, and I strive to achieve success, so that there is a better chance of fulfilling this.</big></big></p>

        <big><big>As a little girl, I imagined living in a small sunny town in the south of France, in my house with a garden, with my family and with a cute dog. All this may sound childish, but my idea of a future life has not changed in any way. I still want to move to Europe (preferably France), have a big family, travel a lot and enjoy every minute of my life.</big></big>
<p><big><big>I understand that my naivety is still with me, but I am really happy that I am who I am, and that I continue to pursue my dream (I have already started to actively learn French and signed up for courses to participate in the exchange program).</big></big></p>
    <p><big><big>I want to hope and give myself a promise that I can cope with all the difficulties on my way (without them there will be nothing) and achieve my goal/dream.</big></big></p>
