    <p><big><big>After school and passing the state exams, I didn't think long about going to university. I was and am fond of all my conscious life in the humanities: history, foreign languages, psychology, social studies and others. In addition, I really want to travel, live and try to study in other unknown conditions (for me): at a university in another country.</big></big></p>

        <big><big>Everything that I would like to try and study is at the Pedagogical University. But I deliberately chose to study in my city, so that there was more chance to save money for a "dream", and not spend it on living in another city.</big></big>

   <p><big><big>And also, I admire people, because each of us is individual and attractive in his own way, so I would like to have a profession that will contact them. And teaching others something new, constant development and learning is included in the profession of a teacher.</big></big></p>
